![Shell Terminal Logo](/images/shell.png)

This is a basic implementation of a command-line shell written in C++. It provides users with a simple and interactive environment to execute various commands related to file system operations and script execution. 
The code aims to replicate some of the functionalities of a traditional shell, allowing users to navigate directories, create and delete files and directories, copy and move files, and execute scripts written in C++ and Python.

## Features:
- **Command Execution:**The program allows the user to enter various commands like 'ls', 'pwd', 'cd', 'rm', 'cp', 'mkdir', 'touch', 'man', 'mv', 'clear', 'nano', 'rename', 'exec', and 'run'.
- **Help Function:** The 'help' command displays a list of available commands along with brief descriptions of each command.
- **File and Directory Operations:** The 'cd' command allows changing the current working directory. Without any arguments, it changes to the home directory.
- **Script Execution:**The 'run' command allows running shell scripts. The 'exec' command allows executing scripts or program files in C++ or Python.
- **External Text Editor:** The 'nano' command opens a text editor (notepad) for the specified file.
- **Execution of C++ and Python Files:** The program allows compilation and execution of C++ and Python files.
